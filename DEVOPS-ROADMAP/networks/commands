Network files
Network settings are located in the following files and directories:

/etc/sysconfig/network file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory
/etc/hosts
/etc/resolv.conf
/etc/nsswitch.conf
/etc/services
Each of the configuration files is used for different network operations.

The files in the network-scripts directory are used for network configuration.

Network settings are stored in files starting with ifcfg and are named according to the network interface, such as eth0, eth1, etc.

The network settings include:

DEVICE – the name of the network interface
ONBOOT – whether the network interface should be activated at boot time
BOOTPROTO – how the network settings should be configured (static, dhcp, bootp)
IPADDR – the IP address
NETMASK – the netmask
BROADCAST – the broadcast address
GATEWAY – the gateway address

Various settings such as MAC address and network type are also available.

To obtain an IP address using DHCP, it is sufficient to set the DEVICE, BOOTPROTO, and ONBOOT parameters.

Network operations
The network service must be restarted for changes in the files to take effect.

The stop parameter is used to stop the network.

  -service network stop
The start parameter is used to start the network.

  -service network start
The restart or reload parameter is used to restart the network.

  -service network restart
  -service network reload
Getting network information
The ifconfig command can be used to obtain network information.

  -ifconfig
The command lists the IP address, MAC address, packet information, etc. for the active network interfaces on the system.

To obtain information for a specific network interface, simply specify the name of the interface as a parameter.

  -ifconfig eth0
The command can also be used to set various temporary settings for a network interface.

  -ifconfig eth0 <IP_Address> netmask <Netmask_Address> broadcast <Broadcast_Address>

To make the settings permanent, the configuration file for the network interface must be edited.

The down parameter is used to disable a network interface.

  -ifconfig eth0 down
  -ifdown eth0
The up parameter is used to enable a network interface.

  -ifconfig eth0 up
  -ifup eth0
The ip command can also be used to obtain network information.

Using graphical tools in the command prompt to configure network settings can help prevent errors.

Network commands
The netstat command is used to monitor and track network information.

  -netstat
The -i parameter is used to obtain network statistics.

  -netstat -i
The ping command is used to check connectivity to an address.

  -ping <address>
The -c parameter is used to specify the number of packets to send.

  -ping -c <address>
The traceroute command is used to obtain information about the path used to reach a remote machine.

  -traceroute <address>
The telnet command is used to connect to a remote machine using the telnet protocol.

  -telnet <address>
The ftp command is used to connect to a remote machine using the ftp protocol.

  -ftp <address>
After the command is started, various ftp commands are used for different operations.
